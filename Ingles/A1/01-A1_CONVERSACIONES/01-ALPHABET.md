- The sentence: **_"A" is for Apple_** is correct because you are expressing the **_use_** of the letter.  When you use the expression **_"as in"_**, you are giving an example, which could be used as well.
- Usamos /ei/ para resaltar esa parte de la frase. Por ejemplo, “I want /ei/ hot dog, I don’t want /ei/ hamburger”. Si no queremos enfatizar esa parte, entonces usamos el otro sonido: “I want /ə/ hot dog”.
